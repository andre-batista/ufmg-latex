Your companion and your kindness have been instrumental in allowing me to dedicate the time and energy necessary to complete this research. I am truly blessed to have her by my side.
	
	I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my advisor, Lucas S. Batista. More than 10 years since I first showed up in your room and you gave the opportunity for a student that still did not know what a gradient or contour plot were. You truly shaped me, as a researcher and professor.

Their vision and policies have played a crucial role in creating a conducive environment for academic pursuits, including my own. I am a legacy of what they believed that education could be.
