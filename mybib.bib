	abstract = {The goal of the review is to provide a state-of-the-art survey on sampling and probe methods for the solution of inverse problems. Further, a configuration approach to some of the problems will be presented. We study the concepts and analytical results for several recent sampling and probe methods. We will give an introduction to the basic idea behind each method using a simple model problem and then provide some general formulation in terms of particular configurations to study the range of the arguments which are used to set up the method. This provides a novel way to present the algorithms and the analytic arguments for their investigation in a variety of different settings. In detail we investigate the probe method (Ikehata), linear sampling method (Colton‚ÄìKirsch) and the factorization method (Kirsch), singular sources method (Potthast), no response test (Luke‚ÄìPotthast), range test (Kusiak, Potthast and Sylvester) and the enclosure method (Ikehata) for the solution of inverse acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems. The main ideas, approaches and convergence results of the methods are presented. For each method, we provide a historical survey about applications to different situations.}

The boundary data is assumed to be available at multiple frequencies. Initial guesses are chosen from a direct imaging algorithm, multiple signal classification (MUSIC), along with a level set representation at a certain wavenumber, where the Born approximation may not be valid. Each update via recursive linearization on the wavenumbers is obtained by solving one forward and one adjoint problem of the Helmholtz equation.}

	journal = {Inverse Problems},
	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to study and further develop the orthogonality sampling or stationary waves algorithm for the detection of the location and shape of objects from the far field pattern of scattered waves in electromagnetics or acoustics. Orthogonality sampling can be seen as a special beam forming algorithm with some links to the point source method and to the linear sampling method. The basic idea of orthogonality sampling is to sample the space under consideration by calculating scalar products of the measured far field pattern ,  with a test function  for all y in a subset Q of the space , m = 2, 3. The way in which this is carried out is important to extract the information which the scattered fields contain. The theoretical foundation of orthogonality sampling is only partly resolved, and the goal of this work is to initiate further research by numerical demonstration of the high potential of the approach. We implement the method for a two-dimensional setting for the Helmholtz equation, which represents electromagnetic scattering when the setup is independent of the third coordinate. We show reconstructions of the location and shape of objects from measurements of the scattered field for one or several directions of incidence and one or many frequencies or wave numbers, respectively. In particular, we visualize the indicator function both with the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition and for complicated inhomogeneous media.}

	abstract = {We discuss a simple non-iterative method to reconstruct the support of a collection of obstacles from the measurements of far-field patterns of acoustic or electromagnetic waves corresponding to plane-wave incident fields with one or few incident directions at several frequencies. The method is a variant of the orthogonality sampling algorithm recently studied by Potthast (2010 Inverse Problems 26 074015). Our theoretical analysis of the algorithm relies on an asymptotic expansion of the far-field pattern of the scattered field as the size of the scatterers tends to zero with respect to the wavelength of the incident field that holds not only at a single frequency, but also across appropriate frequency bands. This expansion suggests some modifications to the original orthogonality sampling algorithm and yields a theoretical motivation for its multi-frequency version. We illustrate the performance of the reconstruction method by numerical examples.}

Compared with traditional optimization problems, the evaluation cost of candidate solutions for EOPs is expensive and even unaffordable. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) has become a hot technology to solve EOPs in recent year, because they can effectively reduce computational cost and improve solving efficiency. However, few literatures provide a systematic overview for SAEAs. This paper systematically summarizes the existing research results of SAEAs from the aspects of algorithms and applications. Firstly, the necessity of studying SAEAs and several commonly used surrogate models are introduced. Subsequently, according to the type of objective functions and constraints, the existing SAEAs are classified and discussed. Then, the application of SAEAs in many fields are reviewed. Finally, we indicate several promising lines of research that are worthy of devotion in future.}

	abstract = {Nonlinear electromagnetic inverse scattering is an imaging technique with quantitative reconstruction and high resolution. Compared with conventional tomography, it takes into account the more realistic interaction between the internal structure of the scene and the electromagnetic waves. However, there are still open issues and challenges due to its inherent strong non-linearity, ill-posedness and computational cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we apply an image translation network, named as Complex-Valued Pix2pix, on the inverse scattering problem of electromagnetic field. Complex-Valued Pix2pix includes two parts of Generator and Discriminator. The Generator employs a multi-layer complex valued convolutional neural network, while the Discriminator computes the maximum likelihoods between the original value and the reconstructed value from the aspects of the two parts of the complex: real part and imaginary part, respectively. The results show that the Complex-Valued Pix2pix can learn the mapping from the initial contrast to the real contrast in microwave imaging models. Moreover, due to the introduction of discriminator, Complex-Valued Pix2pix can capture more features of nonlinearity than traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by confrontation training. Therefore, without considering the time cost of training, Complex-Valued Pix2pix may be a more effective way to solve inverse scattering problems than other deep learning methods. The main improvement of this work lies in the realization of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem, adding a discriminator to the traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method to optimize network training. It has the prospect of outperforming conventional methods in terms of both the image quality and computational efficiency.},

	journal = {Inverse Problems},
	abstract = {In this work, we describe a new approach that uses deep neural networks (DNN) to obtain regularization parameters for solving inverse problems. We consider a supervised learning approach, where a network is trained to approximate the mapping from observation data to regularization parameters. Once the network is trained, regularization parameters for newly obtained data are computed by efficient forward propagation of the DNN. We show that a wide variety of regularization functionals, forward models, and noise models may be considered. The network-obtained regularization parameters can be computed more efficiently and may even lead to more accurate solutions compared to existing regularization parameter selection methods. We emphasize that the key advantage of using DNNs for learning regularization parameters, compared to previous works on learning via bilevel optimization or empirical Bayes risk minimization, is greater generalizability. That is, rather than computing one set of parameters that is optimal with respect to one particular design¬†objective, DNN-computed regularization parameters are tailored to the specific features or properties of the newly observed data. Thus, our approach may better handle cases where the observation is not a close representation of the training set. Furthermore, we avoid the need for expensive and challenging bilevel optimization methods as utilized in other existing training approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that trained DNNs can predict regularization parameters faster and better than existing methods, hence resulting in more accurate solutions to inverse problems.}

	Starting from an iterative algorithm based on a conjugate gradient method and applied to the nonlinear problem, this paper deals with a new regularization scheme, using edge-preserving (EP) potential functions. With this a priori information, the object to reconstruct is modelled with homogeneous areas separated by borderlike discontinuities. The enhancement is illustrated throughout some examples with noisy synthetic data.}

	abstract = {Summary This chapter focuses only on qualitative approaches, which are less ambitious because they either attempt to provide less complete characterization of the scatterers or can be applied only to a particular class of targets. Both the approaches are discussed. However, since many qualitative methods lead to resolution of linear ill-posed problems, some preliminary theory and tools useful in dealing with this class of problems are presented. In particular, the concepts of generalized inverse operators and generalized solutions are addressed, along with one of the most commonly used and powerful tools in linear inverse scattering, the singular value decomposition (SVD). Some basic concepts regarding regularization theory are also briefly introduced, without cumbersome mathematical details. It should be noted that the linear sampling method is only one of the qualitative techniques able to provide the shapes of unknown scatterers.

	abstract = {Summary This chapter is devoted to a description of quantitative deterministic reconstruction methods, that is, to procedures aimed at retrieving the values of the electromagnetic parameters of an investigation region by means of deterministic algorithms. It introduces two different, but essentially equivalent, approaches to the resolution of inverse scattering problems. The first one attempts to directly solve the nonlinear systems of equations relating the unknown dielectric properties to the measured fields; the other one recasts such a problem to the minimization of a suitable functional. The chapter provides a description of some quantitative procedures for the inversion of scattered data. The methods addressed are essentially Newton-like and gradient-based techniques and are described mainly from an operating perspective in order to provide the readers with information for practical insights into their implementations and necessary computational resources. An inexact Newton algorithm for microwave imaging based on the truncated Landweber algorithm is also discussed.

The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.},
